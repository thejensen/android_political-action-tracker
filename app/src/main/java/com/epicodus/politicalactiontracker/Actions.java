The media was a powerful tool in this last election and we will discuss our role in connecting with our local and national media sources. This first workshop will discuss print media, its political power, and how we can use it to express our opinions and values. We will provide content topics, such as current local protest events, the president elect's conflicts of interest, etc. Please feel free to show up unprepared or, if you have a burning topic that you'd like to articulate to our local press, please bring that with you and feel free to message us ahead of time with it. What to bring: • laptop • paper and pen • your convictions, values, experience, thoughts and feelings. We look forward to hearing your voices. Please RSVP on the Pantsuit Nation Portland Meetup page",};
